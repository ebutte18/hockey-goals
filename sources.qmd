The primary source I utilized for this project was "https://moneypuck.com/data.htm". This source has NHL stats from 2007 to the present day, offering a wonderful opportunity for those who want to gain insights from hockey analytics. I cleaned the data by removing NULL values and filtering to different teams to gain more narrow information.
