My name is Eric Butte, a former college hockey player whose github account can be reached at "https://github.com/ebutte18", and an email which is "ebutte18@gmail.com". My project is concerned with scoring goals in the National Hockey League (NHL) and what insight I can offer to General Managers to improve their rosters. The link to my Github repository is "https://github.com/ebutte18/hockey-goals.git". This project was created as a part of Kane's Data Science Bootcamp, https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/.
